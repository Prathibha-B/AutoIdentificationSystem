Project Overview 

It is a software application designed to automate the identification process based on predefined parameters. The system streamlines authentication, verification, and classification tasks, reducing manual effort and improving efficiency.

Features Automated Identification: The system processes and verifies identities using predefined criteria. 

User Authentication: Secure login mechanism for authorized access. 

Database Management: Stores user details securely. 

API Integration: Connects with external systems for data validation. 

Scalability: Supports future enhancements and additional functionalities.

Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript – For building the user interface. Bootstrap – Ensures a responsive design. 

Backend Java (Spring Boot, Servlets, JSTL) – Handles business logic and API endpoints. Database MySQL – Manages user and system data. Middleware Spring MVC – Facilitates request handling. Hibernate – Provides ORM capabilities. Version Control & Deployment Git – Used for source code management. Jenkins – Automates build and deployment pipelines.

System Design: 

The application follows an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:

Model: Manages business logic and database interactions. View: User interface for interaction. Controller: Handles user requests and communicates with the model.

Setup Instructions Clone the Repository -> bash ->  Copy -> Edit ->  git clone <repository_url>   ->  cd AutoIdentificationSystem

Set Up the Database Install MySQL and create a database named auto_identification_system. Run the provided SQL scripts to create required tables.

Configure the Backend Update the “application.properties” file with database credentials. Build and run the backend using: arduino Copy -> Edit ->  mvn clean install -> mvn spring-boot:run Run the Frontend

Open index.html in a browser.

Deployment The system can be deployed using Jenkins by setting up an automated pipeline that builds and deploys the project to a server. Contributing Fork the repository. Create a feature branch (git checkout -b feature-branch). Commit changes and push (git push origin feature-branch). Open a pull request for review.

How the Application Works

1.	System Overview The application is designed to automate the process of identifying users or entities based on predefined criteria. It collects input, processes it through backend logic, verifies the information, and provides results based on the validation process.

The system consists of the following major components: User Interface (Frontend) Backend Processing Database Management API Integration Authentication & Authorization Deployment & Version Control

2. Workflow & Functionality 


Step 1: User Input & Authentication The user accesses the system via a web browser. A login page appears where users enter their username and password. The credentials are validated against stored records in the database. If authentication is successful, the user is redirected to the dashboard. 

Step 2: Data Submission & Processing The user uploads identification data (e.g., name, ID number, biometrics, or other unique identifiers). The frontend sends the data to the backend via API calls.
The backend applies business logic and validation rules to check for: Duplicates Incorrect formats Existing records in the database External system verification (if API integration is enabled)

Step 3: Data Verification & Identification The system matches the input data against: Stored records in the MySQL database. Third-party APIs (e.g., government ID verification). If a match is found, the system confirms the identity and grants access. If verification fails, the user receives an error message with instructions to correct the input. 

Step 4: Output & Decision Making The system displays the result: Successful Identification: The system provides access to further functionalities. Failed Identification: The user receives an error message or a request for additional verification. In some cases, an admin or external authority may need to approve the verification. 

3. Key System Components 

Frontend (User Interface) Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap. Provides a responsive UI for user interaction. Includes: Login Page – User authentication. Dashboard – Displays user details & verification status. Forms – For uploading and entering ID information. Backend Processing Developed using Java (Spring Boot, Servlets, JSTL). Handles: User authentication & session management. Data processing & verification logic. Interaction with the database. API communication for external verification. Database Management Uses MySQL for storing: User credentials. Identification records. Audit logs for tracking verification attempts. The database is managed with Hibernate ORM for seamless integration. API Integration The system supports external API calls for real-time verification with third-party services. Example: Government ID verification or biometric authentication. Authentication & Authorization The system implements role-based access control. Uses Spring Security for securing sensitive data. Users with admin roles can manage records and override verifications. Deployment & Version Control The project is maintained in Git for version control. Jenkins pipelines handle automated deployment to production servers. The system can be deployed on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, or IBM Cloud). 

4. Example Use Case Scenario: A financial institution wants to automate customer onboarding with identity verification.
Process: A new user registers by entering their personal details. The system validates the details using database records & government APIs. If verification is successful, an account is created. The user receives confirmation and can proceed with banking services.

5. Future Enhancements Biometric Authentication (Fingerprint, Face ID). AI-based Fraud Detection. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for increased security. Cloud-based scalability to handle high-volume data.
